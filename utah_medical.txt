considers appropriate.
(a) In determining any form of custody, including a change in custody, the court shall consider
the best interests of the child without preference for either the mother or father solely because of the
biological sex of the parent and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the following:
(i) the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties;
(ii) which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including allowing the child
frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent;
(iii) the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality, and nature of
the relationship between a parent and child;
(iv) whether the parent has intentionally exposed the child to pornography or material harmful to
a minor, as defined in Section 76-10-1201; and
(v) those factors outlined in Section 30-3-10.2.
(b) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody, as defined in Section 30-3-
10.1, is in the best interest of the child, except in cases where there is:
(i) domestic violence in the home or in the presence of the child;
(ii) special physical or mental needs of a parent or child, making joint legal custody
unreasonable;

impractical in certain circumstances; or

30-3-10.2.
23
(c) The person who desires joint legal custody shall file a proposed parenting plan in accordance
with Sections 30-3-10.8 and 30-3-10.9. A presumption for joint legal custody may be rebutted by a
showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is not in the best interest of the child.

that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the children be heard and
there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.

regarding future custody or parent-time schedules, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the
court may determine the children's custody or parent-time otherwise. The desires of a child 14 years of
age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single controlling factor.
(f) If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection (1)(e), they
shall be conducted by the judge in camera. The prior consent of the parties may be obtained but is not
necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only method to ascertain the child's
desires regarding custody.
(2) In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds relevant,
which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the child frequent
and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.
(3) If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall take that
evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other parent.
(4) (a) Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), a court may not discriminate against a parent due
to a disability, as defined in Section 57-21-2, in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial
change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.
(b) If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody or determining whether
a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody, the parent with a
disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the disability by showing that:
(i) the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent's ability to provide for
the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue; or
(ii) the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available to
supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue.
(c) Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under Title 78B,
Chapter 6, Part 1, Utah Adoption Act.

custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest discretion to choose a
parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.

described under Subsection (1)(a)(i), a court may not discriminate against a parent because of the parent's
possession or consumption of cannabis, a cannabis product, or a medical cannabis device, in accordance
with Title 26, Chapter 60b, Medical Cannabis Act, or because of the parent's status as a cannabis
production establishment agent in accordance with Title 4, Chapter 41b, a cannabis dispensary agent in

78A-6-508. Evidence of grounds for termination.
(1) In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima facie evidence
of abandonment that the parent or parents:
(a) although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of the child,
and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the child or to the person
having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical custody or to make
arrangements for the care of the child;
(b) have failed to communicate with the child by mail, telephone, or otherwise for six months;
(c) failed to have shown the normal interest of a natural parent, without just cause; or
(d) have abandoned an infant, as described in Subsection 78A-6-316(1).
(2) In determining whether a parent or parents are unfit or have neglected a child the court shall
consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances, conduct, or conditions:
(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders the parent
unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child for extended
periods of time;
(b) conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or abusive nature;
(c) habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or dangerous drugs
that render the parent unable to care for the child;
(d) repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter,
education, or other care necessary for the child's physical, mental, and emotional health and development
by a parent or parents who are capable of providing that care;
(e) whether the parent is incarcerated as a result of conviction of a felony, and the sentence is of
such length that the child will be deprived of a normal home for more than one year;
(f) a history of violent behavior; or
(g) whether the parent has intentionally exposed the child to pornography or material harmful to
a minor, as defined in Section 76-10-1201.
(3) Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(c), the court may not discriminate against a parent because of
the parent's possession or consumption of cannabis, a cannabis product, or a medical cannabis device, in
accordance with Title 26, Chapter 60b, Medical Cannabis Act.
[(3)] (4) A parent who, legitimately practicing the parent's religious beliefs, does not provide
specified medical treatment for a child is not, for that reason alone, a negligent or unfit parent.
[(4)] (5) (a) Notwithstanding Subsection (2), a parent may not be considered neglectful or unfit
because of a health care decision made for a child by the child's parent unless the state or other party to
the proceeding shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that the health care decision is not reasonable
and informed.
(b) Nothing in Subsection [(4)] (5)(a) may prohibit a parent from exercising the right to obtain a
second health care opinion.
[(5)] (6) If a child has been placed in the custody of the division and the parent or parents fail to
comply substantially with the terms and conditions of a plan within six months after the date on which the
child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that failure to comply is evidence
of failure of parental adjustment.
[(6)] (7) The following circumstances constitute prima facie evidence of unfitness:
28
(a) sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, injury, or death of a sibling of the child, or of any child, due
to known or substantiated abuse or neglect by the parent or parents;
(b) conviction of a crime, if the facts surrounding the crime are of such a nature as to indicate the
unfitness of the parent to provide adequate care to the extent necessary for the child's physical, mental, or
emotional health and development;
(c) a single incident of life-threatening or gravely disabling injury to or disfigurement of the
child;
(d) the parent has committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder
or manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide; or
(e) the parent intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the
child, without legal justification.
